 MEMORY Memory information.
    See 'doc memory' for more information on how to make the
    best use of memory when running MATLAB.
 
    MEMORY when called without an output argument displays
    information about how much memory is available and how
    much is currently being used by MATLAB. All values are double
    precision and in units of bytes.
 
    USERVIEW = MEMORY returns information about how much memory is
    available and how much is currently being used by MATLAB. USERVIEW
    is a structure that contains the following fields:
       MaxPossibleArrayBytes -- The largest contiguous free memory block.
          It is an upper bound on the largest single array that MATLAB can
          currently create. This field is the smaller of these two values:
             a) The largest contiguous memory block found in the
                MATLAB virtual address space, or
             b) The total available system memory.
          To find the number of elements, divide MaxPossibleArrayBytes
          by the size of each element in bytes. For example, divide by
          eight for a double matrix. The actual number of elements that
          that can be created is always less than this number.
       MemAvailableAllArrays -- The total amount of memory available
          for data. This field is the smaller of these two values:
             a) The total available MATLAB virtual address space, or
             b) The total available system memory.
          The amount of memory available is guaranteed to be at least
          as large as this field.
       MemUsedMATLAB -- The total amount of system memory reserved for the
          MATLAB process. This is the sum of the physical memory and
          potential swap file usage.
 
    [USERVIEW, SYSTEMVIEW] = MEMORY returns additional, and more detailed
    information about the current state of memory usage.  SYSTEMVIEW is a 
    structure containing the following:
       VirtualAddressSpace -- A 2-field structure that contains the
          amount of available memory and the total amount of virtual
          memory for the MATLAB process.
       SystemMemory -- A 1-field structure that contains the amount of
          available system memory. This number includes the amount of
          available physical memory and the amount of available swap file 
          space on the computer running MATLAB.
       PhysicalMemory -- A 2-field structure that contains the amount of
          available physical memory and the total amount of physical memory
          on the computer running MATLAB.  It can be useful as a measure
          of how much data can be accessed quickly.
 
    The MEMORY function is currently available on PCWIN and PCWIN64 only.
    Results will vary depending on the computer running MATLAB, the load
    on the computer, and what MATLAB is doing at the time.
 
    Example 1: Run the MEMORY command on a 32-bit Windows system:
 
        >> memory
        Maximum possible array:             677 MB (7.101e+008 bytes) *
        Memory available for all arrays:   1602 MB (1.680e+009 bytes) **
        Memory used by MATLAB:              327 MB (3.425e+008 bytes)
        Physical Memory (RAM):             3327 MB (3.489e+009 bytes)
 
        *  Limited by contiguous virtual address space available.
        ** Limited by virtual address space available.

    Example 2: Run the MEMORY command on a 64-bit Windows system:
 
        >> memory
        Maximum possible array:               4577 MB (4.800e+009 bytes) *
        Memory available for all arrays:      4577 MB (4.800e+009 bytes) *
        Memory used by MATLAB:                 330 MB (3.458e+008 bytes)
        Physical Memory (RAM):                3503 MB (3.674e+009 bytes)
 
        *  Limited by System Memory (physical + swap file) available.

    Example 3: Run the MEMORY command with two outputs on a 32-bit Windows
               system:
 
        >> [uV sV] = memory
 
        uV = 
 
            MaxPossibleArrayBytes: 710127616
            MemAvailableAllArrays: 1.6797e+009
                    MemUsedMATLAB: 345354240
 
 
        sV = 
 
            VirtualAddressSpace: [1x1 struct]
                   SystemMemory: [1x1 struct]
                 PhysicalMemory: [1x1 struct]
 
        >> sV.VirtualAddressSpace
 
        ans = 
 
            Available: 1.6797e+009
                Total: 2.1474e+009

        ans =

        >> sV.PhysicalMemory
