function Y = f_filterSinclair(X,rep)
% - filter/smooth columns of a matrix via 11-point Moving Median + Average
%
% USAGE: Y = f_filterSinclair(X,rep);
%
% X = input matrix (rows = observations, cols = variables)
% Y = filtered/smoothed data
% rep = # of times to filter data                             (default = 1)
%
% SEE ALSO: f_filterMA

% -----Notes:-----
% This function uses the method of Sinclair et al. (1998) to filter/smooth
% time series data (or remove outliers) by first applying an 11-point
% moving median, then an 11-point moving average. This method is also
% recommended by Sanborn & Telmer (2003). Each column of data is smoothed
% separately by the same type of filter.
